    <title>Supported File Formats</title>
    <par>Image file format is device independent representation of image data.
    Images in these formats are usually stored as external
    files on hard disk. Many different file formats
    have been created but majority of the images stored anywhere
    are saved in one of a few most widely used formats.
    Main goal of Imaging's file format support is to fully support
    these widely used formats. This means
    successful loading and saving of all images stored in these formats.
    So if you have some image in one of supported formats and it can not
    be loaded by Imaging, please send it to me so I will be able to fix it.
