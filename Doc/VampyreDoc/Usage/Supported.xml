    <title>Supported Compilers and Platforms</title>
    <par>
      Main development language is <b>ObjectPascal</b> and two
      main supported compilers are <b>Borland Delphi</b> and <b>Free Pascal</b>.
      <b>Kylix</b> works too but <b>C++ Builder</b> crashes on internal error.
      Other Pascal compilers like GPC or TMT were not tested.
      Supported platforms are now <b>Windows</b>, <b>Linux</b>, <b>FreeBSD</b>
      (some other Unix systems most probably too),
      and <b>DOS</b> (and <b>.NET</b> using unmanaged DLL).
      Imaging was tested on 32bit <b>x86</b>
      and 64bit <b>AMD64</b> (Linux only - no Win64 Pascal compiler now)
      CPU architectures.
      It could work on some big endian machines too (except some file format loaders
      that assume little endian) but I can't test it on any.

      been tested and whether Imaging was successfully compiled by them.

    <par>
      If you want use Imaging as external dll/so library you are not restricted
      only to <b>ObjectPascal</b> but you can use any other programming language
      which has wrapper to dll/so written. Wrappers for other languages can be
      found in <keyword>Source/Wrappers</keyword> directory.
      Following tables contain information about which compilers have
      been tested and whether program using wrapper was successfully
      compiled by them (for <b>ObjectPascal</b> wrapper look at previous table).
