      Imaging's functionality can be extended by so called
      extensions. These provide image effect functions, drawing functions
      additional file formats and other.

      Extensions can be divided into two categories. One that is used
      automaticaly by Imaging core like image file format extensions.
      Imaging will register all these extensions on startup.
      These extensions create larger executables and libraries
      which you may consider a bad thing especially
      if you does not use any functions provided by these extensions.
      Because of that extensions can be turned on or off during compilation.
      This is done by defining/undefining <keyword>LINK_*</keyword>
      symbols in <keyword>ImagingOptions.inc</keyword> include file
      located in <keyword>Source</keyword> directory.
      All these extensions are turned on by default in include file.
    </par>
    <par>
      Second category extensions provide user interface to some
      extended functions like <keyword>OpenGL</keyword> texture creation.
      These extensions are ordinary Pascal units. If you want to use them
      simply add these units to your project's uses list and call their functions.
      Those extensions are currently not accessible using DLL/SO interface.
