    <title>Vampyre Imaging Library Future</title>

    <par>
      In the long term I'm planning to redesign and rewrite major parts of library in
      future to make it more compact and easier to use and extend.
      First version of this new design should be 0.30
      (probably in late 2007) but few more versions based on
      old design should be released before that.
    </par>
    
    <par>Here is a list of some of the features I want to include in future
    Imaging releases:</par>
    <bulletlist>
      <li>register your own data formats</li>
      <li>native Pascal JPEG2000 support</li>
      <li>more texture related functions</li>
      <li>extend canvas class (more effects, blended drawing, drawing of various primitives)</li>
      <li>more fast canvas classes</li>
      <li>own file format?</li>
      <li>more supported platforms (big endian)</li>
    </bulletlist>
