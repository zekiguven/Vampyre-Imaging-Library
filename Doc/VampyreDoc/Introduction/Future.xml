    <title>Vampyre Imaging Library Future</title>

    <par>
      In the long term I'm planning to redesign and rewrite major parts
      (practically create new library - no compatibility with current version)
      of library in
      future to make it more compact and easier to use and extend.
      First working version of this new design will be 0.30 (Imaging 0.3x branch in SVN)
      and first release will be version 0.40 (sometime in 2008).
      Few more versions based on old design should be released before that
      (although current 0.24 is probably last major one).
    </par>
    
    <par>Here is a list of some of the features I want to include in future
    Imaging releases:</par>
    <bulletlist>
      <li>new library</li>
      <li>native Pascal TIFF support</li>
      <li>register your own data formats</li>
      <li>native Pascal JPEG2000 support</li>
      <li>more texture related functions</li>
      <li>extend canvas class (more effects, blended drawing, drawing of various primitives)</li>
